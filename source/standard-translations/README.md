## Squid Proxy

This parser and XSLT translation are designed to convert the default format of Squid proxy logs into event-logging XML. These can be used 'out of the box' to normalise access logs from a Squid proxy if the default log format has been used. If a custom format has been used then these entities can be used as a starting point for creating a bespoke translation.

Details of the standard Squid proxy log format can be found at [wiki.squid-cache.org](http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/LogFormat#squid).

Examples of Squid proxy logs can be found at (log-sharing.dreamhosters.com)[http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com].
