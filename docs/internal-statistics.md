# _internal-statistics_ Content Pack

Internal statistics are a set of StatisticStore entities that represent the statistic data sets generated internally by _Stroom_. They provide various metrics about the state of the _Stroom_ application its storage tier and its underlying hardware.

## Contents

The following represents the folder structure and content that will be imported in to Stroom with this content pack.
